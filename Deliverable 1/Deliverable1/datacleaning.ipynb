Because it was one of the earlier dates, we looked through the other points as well and found missing values for similar data points (same date etc.). Therefore we ran through and put 0 for the 0-19 as it was too early for people of that age to be vaccinated, and summed up values for total. The early datapoints are also missing booster information but that being said - the booster is not out for earlier data points. Therefore we left those points empty with NaN values.\n",
